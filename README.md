# Shape-Detector
This C++ program, using the OpenCV library, performs contour detection on an image to identify and classify various shapes, including triangles, squares, rectangles, pentagons, hexagons, and circles.

It applies image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection, and contour approximation to extract and analyze the shapes in the image. The program displays the detected shapes and labels them accordingly.
This project showcases proficiency in contour detection, shape recognition, and image analysis, making it a valuable addition to a portfolio focused on computer vision and shape detection applications.
